# VHDL (DSD course)

There are 6 homeworks for learning vhdl. Written with love. :)
thanks to ali rezasoltani for collaborating.

another really good implementation could be found [here](https://github.com/amirhallaji/VHDL-Projects-Fall99/)

## how to use

1. install modelsim
2. create folder name `vhdl-folder` in desktop
3. change username part in `script.do` and `run.bat` files to your user. (or completely change the path. Why not.)
4. create `work` library in modelsim (in the vhdl folder of course).
5. place all `projectx` folders to work folder
6. open modelsim and run the `script.do` file. That will compile module and test bench and show the waves.
7. or even better, just run bat file. That will open modelsim too.
