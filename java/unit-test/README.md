# Unit test

## why this class?
+ Clean coder book -> TDD chapter 

## why unit test?
+ save money, lives
+ Quality of code
+ find bugs easily 
+ easy re-factor 
+ design? decoupling


## in depth
+ who? developer or QA?
+ what is code coverage? how much?
+ CI -> continues integration
+ courage to change -> legacy code = code without change 
+ test: example of how to use code 


## TDD 
+ cycle times : 30 seconds 
+ Red, Green, re-factor 
  1. write failing test
  2. write production test as much as necessary to pass test
+ design: why not test after code
